FOREWORD 
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of 
telecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs). The ITU Telecommunication 
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, 
operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing 
telecommunications on a worldwide basis. 
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, 
establishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on 
these topics. 
The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1. 
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are 
prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC. 
 
 
 
NOTE 
In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a 
telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency. 
Compliance with this Recommendation is voluntary. However, the Recommendation may contain certain 
mandatory provisions (to ensure e.g. interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the 
Recommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met.  The words "shall" or some 
other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The 
use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party. 
 
 
 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may 
involve the use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence, 
validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others 
outside of the Recommendation development process. 
As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had not received notice of intellectual property, 
protected by patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementers 
are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the 
TSB patent database at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/.

Recommendation ITU-T A.31 
Guidelines and coordination requirements  
for the organization of ITU-T workshops and seminars 
(2008) 
1 Scope 
This Recommendation provides guidelines and coordination requirements for the organization of workshops 
and seminars by ITU-T. These workshops and seminars aim for discussion and dissemination of the 
development of standards for worldwide implementation in telecommunications carried out by the study 
groups (SGs) of ITU-T.

Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). 
3 Definitions 
3.1 Terms defined elsewhere 
None. 
3.2 Terms defined in this Recommendation 
This Recommendation defines the following terms: 
3.2.1 seminar: The seminar is a primarily one-way format, focused on the dissemination of information, 
in what amounts to classroom-style format. Depending on the subject and/or audience, there may be a lesser 
or greater degree of participant interaction with the experts who are presenting. 
3.2.2 workshop: The workshop environment is fundamentally a meeting of peers, gathered to discuss 
technical, implementation, industry, or strategic issues. Workshops can span a spectrum of styles, from 
highly technical events focusing on a single detailed issue, to broader gatherings intended to expose a wide 
spectrum of input and opinion. 
  Rec. ITU-T A.31 (10/2008) 1 
 
4 Abbreviations and acronyms 
This Recommendation uses the following abbreviations and acronyms: 
SC Steering committee 
SDO Standards development organization 
SGs Study groups 
5 Conventions 
Terminologies and definitions throughout this Recommendation must be considered in accordance with the 
ITU-T ''Author's guide for drafting ITU-T Recommendations". 
6 Choice of the proper event format 
6.1 The format, scope and goals of each planned event must be determined at the start of the event-
planning process, as these choices will determine the addressable target audience, and trigger the workshop 
or seminar notification and promotion process. The awareness of these nuances among different workshop 
and seminar events is relevant to appropriate event planning and, therefore, to consistent and successful 
results. 
6.2 As a way forward to accomplish organization consistency and reach common understanding on the 
Sector's needs, and to facilitate cooperation and coordination in the organization of cross-Sector events, the 
above-mentioned standardized terminology (see clause 3) should be observed in order to cope with different 
characteristics of events within the Sector. 
7 Event format specifics 
7.1 Seminars 
Seminars are most useful in sharing ITU-T vision and technical knowledge with new participants who have 
not previously been exposed to the scope, workings, or results of the ITU-T standardization process. 
7.2 Workshops 
Workshops are the preferred vehicle for demonstrations, technical issue resolution, and for the creation of 
specific deliverables (outputs). A workshop should have clear goals and a limited scope, setting and 
delivering upon well-defined expectations from the participants and workshop leaders. 
8 Event coordination 
Aiming at the improvement of the organization of ITU-T workshops and seminars, and coordination with the 
other two Sectors and the General Secretariat for the preparation, running and evaluation of workshops and 
seminars, four types of ITU-T workshops and seminars are defined, according to the distinct levels of 
1
coordination and the structures, scopes and goals each type requires. 
____________________

  Some of the events defined in this Recommendation may have a mixed nature, such as dissemination of information 
and promotion. 
2 Rec. ITU-T A.31 (10/2008)  
 
8.1 Study group strategy focused 
8.1.1 These events are focused on a specific technical topic or standardization area. 
8.1.2 The main objective is to review points of current development of technology, application and 
service. 
8.1.3 In general, they gather information on standardization development in other standardization 
development organizations (SDOs). 
8.1.4 They aim at in-depth discussion on the work programme of the SGs, that is, subsequent 
standardization projects, improvements in coordination or cooperation methods with other SDOs, etc. 
8.1.5 The proposal for this type of workshop or seminar normally comes from the SG management teams 
and membership. Speakers are usually proposed and invited by internal experts. 
8.1.6 Such events are in general collocated with SG meetings and the audience comprises mainly SG 
delegates and non-ITU-T members. 
8.1.7 Some of these events are co-organized with the Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) to 
reply to WTSA Resolution 44 concerning the requirements to bridge the standardization gap. 
8.1.8 These events have the following advantages: 
a) they ensure that the workshop or seminar topic is closely relevant to SG work; 
b) they are cost-effective in terms of organization, and avoid extra time/cost to SG delegates; 
c) they have a guaranteed quantity and quality of participants; thus, a guaranteed quality of discussion. 
8.2 Information focused 
8.2.1 These events are focused on a new technology or emerging study area. By carrying them out, it is 
possible to review points of current development of technology, applications and services. 
8.2.2 They are good opportunities for briefing SGs with information regarding standardization 
development in other SDOs. 
8.2.3 The proposal for this type of workshop or seminar normally comes from the SG management teams 
and membership or from the technology watch function of TSB. Speakers are usually proposed and invited 
by internal experts. 
8.2.4 Such events are in general collocated with SG meetings and the audience comprises mainly SG 
delegates. 
8.2.5 These events have the following advantages: 
a) they ensure that the workshop or seminar topic is closely relevant to SG work; 
b) they are cost-effective in terms of organization, and avoid extra time/cost to SG delegates; 
c) they have a guaranteed quantity and quality of participants; thus, a guaranteed quality of discussion; 
d) they could bring new ideas and work topics to relevant SGs. 
8.3 Tutorial focused 
8.3.1 These events are focused on ITU-T SG ongoing work or published Recommendations. Topics are 
selected according to local interest. 
8.3.2 The main goal is to disseminate ITU-T technical knowledge and to promote the products of the 
work on standardization. 
  Rec. ITU-T A.31 (10/2008) 3 
 
8.3.3 They are often co-organized with and funded by BDT and targeted at developing countries. 
8.3.4 ITU-T membership or BDT normally initiates this type of event and proposes topics of interest. The 
Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) informs and relies on the related SG management team to 
look for and identify qualified speakers. 
8.4 Promotion focused 
8.4.1 These events are closely linked to promotion activities held outside ITU in order to promote ITU-T 
work and demonstrate the extent to which ITU contributes in a specific technical area. 
8.4.2 Though this type of event is mostly suggested by one or more SGs, with specific venue and date, it 
might not be collocated with the SG meeting but rather associated with a non-ITU industry event related to 
its study topic. 
9 Event identification 
Once the event format and coordination are properly identified, all related information shall be made 
available to the Steering Committee (SC), who will be responsible for revising and issuing general advice on 
the strategic coordination, planning, organization, programme, implementation, drawing and follow-up 
actions. This SC's task shall be taken according to clause 10 below. 
10 Guidelines and coordination requirements for the organization of ITU-T workshops 
and seminars 
An appropriate working party within the Telecommunication Standardization Advisory Group (TSAG) shall 
undertake the responsibility for all activities and tasks regarding the organization of ITU-T workshops and 
seminars. The following clauses indicate such duties, followed by those within ITU-T to assist TSAG in this
